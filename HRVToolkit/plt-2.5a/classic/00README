This directory contains sources for classic `plt', including drivers for a
variety of mostly obsolete graphics terminals and plotters, as well as
subdirectories that contain sources for PA's `libc' library (used by classic
`plt' programs) and various programs that demonstrate the use of `plt' (in
`demos').

****************************** IMPORTANT **********************************
NO SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE for any of the software in this directory.  You
will find that much of the documentation for modern `plt' will be helpful,
but if you choose to use classic `plt' you are on your own!
****************************************************************************

To install classic `plt' on a new system, edit the site-dependent variables in
`Makefile', make any needed changes to `plt' and `lwcat', then type `make'.

To use classic `plt', follow the examples given in the demos.  If you have both
a graphics display and a PostScript printer, it is usually most convenient to
preview your plots on the display before printing them.  The simplest way to
do this is to leave PTERM unset, set TERM to an appropriate value for your
display (this is normally done in your login script), and run your `plt'
command without a `-T' option;  to print, just rerun the same command, but
add `-T lw' to the `plt' argument list, and pipe the output to `lwcat'.
For example:
	plt xxx ...			(to preview the plot on the display)
	plt -T lw xxx ... | lwcat	(to print the same plot on the printer)

Please note that classic `plt' is no longer maintained and lacks many features
of modern `plt' (which can be found in the directory one level above this one).
Unless you need to plot on one of the devices supported only by classic `plt',
use modern `plt' instead.
